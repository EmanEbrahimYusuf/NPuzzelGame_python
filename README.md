# NPuzzleGame in python
## NPuzzle  by multible search algorithe A star , BFS and DFS
In the N-Puzzle game, you are presented with an N by N board, which contains N^2 - 1 tiles numbered from 1 to N^2 - 1, along with a single empty space. The goal of the game is to rearrange the numbered tiles by sliding them into the empty space, aiming to reach the target configuration in the shortest time possible.

•	Constructed a graph representation of the puzzle.
•	Calculated the shortest path using BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms.
•	Backtracked the shortest path to count the number of movements.
•	Selected the best algorithm based on the shortest time.

## useing in this algorithmes 
* A* algorithme in AStare File
* BFS algorithme in BFS file 
* DFS algorithme in DFS file  
## this project expected to solve N puzzle in shortest time
### there is folder (" Test cases ") this folder contain diffrent test cases of puzzle 
increasing from easy to hareder 
### the language used in this project is python
